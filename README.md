## Purpose

This project was created by [me](https://github.com/kazvee) as part of my learnings at [Lighthouse Labs](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/en/web-development-flex-program).

## A note about `create-react-app`

For larger, production-ready applications, React's official documentation and best practices now recommend other ways to [Start a New React Project](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project)

As this was a small project to further explore React's core concepts and principles, with no plans to scale it up or customise it further, it's been bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) which still provides a straightforward way to quickly spin up a functional React app for learning purposes.
